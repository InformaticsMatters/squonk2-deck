# An example Squeck environments file.
#
# It provides all the connection details for one or more Squonk2 environments.
# It is expected to be found in the user's home directory
# as '~/.squonk2/environments' or the user can 'point' to it by setting
# 'SQUONK2_ENVIRONMENT_FILE', e.g. 'export SQUONK2_ENVIRONMENT_FILE=~/my-env'

# The 'environments' block defines one or more environments.
# Each has a name. Here we define an environment called 'site-a'
# but environments can be called anything YAML accepts as a key,
# although it would aid consistency if you restrict your names to letters
# and hyphens.
environments:
  site-a:
    # The hostname of the keycloak server, without a 'http' prefix
    # and without a '/auth' suffix.
    keycloak-hostname: example.com
    # The realm name used for the Squonk2 environment.
    keycloak-realm: squonk2
    # The Keycloak client IDs of the Account Server and Data Manager.
    # The Account Server client ID is optional.
    keycloak-as-client-id: account-server-api
    keycloak-dm-client-id: data-manager-api
    # The hostnames of the Account Server and Data Manager APIs,
    # without a 'http' prefix and without an 'api' suffix.
    # If you have not provided an Account Server client ID its
    # hostname value is not required.
    as-hostname: as.example.com
    dm-hostname: dm.example.com
    # The username and password of an admin user that has access
    # to the Account Server and Data Manager.
    # The user *MUST* have admin rights.
    admin-user: dlister
    admin-password: blob1234

# The final part of the file is a 'default' property,
# which Squeck uses to select the an environment from the block above
# when all else fails. It's simply the name of one of the environment
# declarations above.
default: site-a
